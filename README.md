# Document Services
Document services are client-local, on-prem, and remote services upon documents, portions of documents, and/or selections of document content. Examples of document services include: spellchecking, grammar checking, proofreading, fact checking, mathematical proof checking, reasoning checking, argumentation checking, and narrative checking.

The [Document Services Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/services/) intends to, in coordination with other groups, create a general-purpose architecture, API's, and protocols for both free and paid-subscription-based document services to convenience document service providers and to equip and empower end-users who will be able to make use of multiple document services simultaneously to better author and review documents.
